# Notes

This file is simply a temporary file that I will use to organize my thoughts and workshops as I write them.

Currently I have removed workshop 0 from the curriculum but I may continue working on it in the future.

## 0. Prelude: Installing Xcode on a macOS VM

`// work in progress (backburner)`

This workshop will cover how to setup your own macOS Virtual Machine [VM], in case you don't have access to your own mac but you still want to develop iOS / macOS apps.
