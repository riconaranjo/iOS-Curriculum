## The Finish Line

`// work in progress`

If you made it through all of these workshops, then congratulations! You are now a super totally officially certified ðŸ”¥ iOS Master. I hope you learned a lot and enjoyed participating in my workshops.

After this I would suggest you keep going, try and make something you think would be cool to make; perhaps make something that you can't find on the app store, or perhaps see if you can replicate an already famous app.
